# What is the Envelope Budgeting Method?
With the envelope method, the budgeter puts together a written budget, and then divvies up cash into separate envelopes for different spending categories. They must limit spending to just what is allotted in the envelope, and by using only what’s in each envelope, it’s impossible to overspend.

# How does the Envelope Budgeting Method Work?
To implement the envelope method, start by tracking your spending. You won’t know how much to put in each envelope until you’ve figured out how much you’re currently spending. You can also try to reduce spending from your current levels, but don’t set a budget that is unrealistic. The goal is to set hard spending limits and use cash instead of credit or debit cards for day-to-day spending.
